StatsTester
===========

Use this to write and test your Bingo assignment.

##Setup
Make sure you are in your projects folder.

```
cd ~/projects
```

Clone the repo.

```  
git clone https://github.com/tpadjen/bingo.git
```

Move into the new folder.

```
cd bingo
```  

##Usage

Write your code in Bingo.java. There is no reason to write a main method, just complete the bingo method. You may write additional helper methods to simplify the logic of your solution.

There is no need to compile your code, the test does it for you. To run the test:

```
./test
```
